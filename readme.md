Using Twine and its interactive tools, I have created a game about Tudor history, specifically focusing on Henry VIII. The narrative of the project follows a Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) format, highlighting significant events from Henry VIII's reign based on true historical accounts. Additionally, the game explores alternative outcomes, posing the question: what if he had chosen a different path?

The story begins in Henry's childhood when he was not expected to become king. However, after the death of his brother, he suddenly became the heir to the throne. The narrative also emphasizes Henry's complex relationships with his six wives, which were heavily affected by his desire for a male heir. When his wives fail to produce a male heir, they face unfortunate fates, such as divorce or execution under various pretexts.

Finally, the story addresses other important events during his reign, including Henry's relationship with the Pope and the English Reformation.
