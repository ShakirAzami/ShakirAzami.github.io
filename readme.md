Using twine and its interactive tools, I have created a game about Tudor's history, in particular about the Henry VIII. The narrative I have used for this project is CYOA,so basically it shades light on important events during the Henry VIII reign according to the true story.Also, there is other side of story like what if he had chosen different path and then what would be the story looked like in that case. The story starts from Henry's childhood and continues to his adult life.In his childhood he was not cosidered to be the next king, but as his brother dies then all of sudden he becomes the next person to the throne.Similarly,the story focuses on Henry's relationship to his six wives,he has a strange relation with his wives due to not having a male heir. Since the wives cant produce a male heir, then either they are divorced or killed under different excuses.finally, the story reflects other events like Henry's relation to  the Pope and reformation in UK.
